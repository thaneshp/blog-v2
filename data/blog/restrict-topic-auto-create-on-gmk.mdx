summary: How to restrict topics from auto-creating on Google Managed Kafka (GMK).
---

If you’ve used Google Managed Kafka (GMK), you might have noticed there is no setting to disable auto-creation of topics.

Disabling auto-creation of topics is managed by the property `auto.create.topics.enable` server-side property that Google Managed Kafka doesn’t expose to users.

Regardless, we can still restrict topics from auto-creating by configuring ACL rules; which I explain below.

---

## Problem

Topics are automatically created when a client produces (or consumes) to Google Managed Kafka.

This is actually a default feature of Apache Kafka, but it is often disabled as any client that has access to the cluster can create topics; which could have unintended behaviours.

In the recording below, you’ll see that when I first tried to produce to a non-existent topic, it throws an error. However, after some time the message successfully publishes, creating a new topic.

## Solution

You can restrict auto-creation of topics on Google Managed Kafka by creating a dummy service account and applying an ACL rule that denies `ALL` operations for `“allTopics”`.

<Callout type="info">
**Why does this work?**

Google Managed Kafka operates with `allow.everyone.if.no.acl.found` property set to `true`.

When no ACL is present for `acl_id = “allTopics”`, then access is enabled by default. As soon as you apply an ACL to this resource, access becomes restricted.

You can read more about GMK’s default access [here](https://docs.cloud.google.com/managed-service-for-apache-kafka/docs/access-control-kafka-acls#default-access).

## Implementation

The Terraform implementation looks something like below.

```HCL
# Dummy service account used solely for applying the ACL rule
resource "google_service_account" "service_account" {
  account_id   = "service-account-id"
  display_name = "Service Account"
}

# ACL rule to restrict auto creation of topics
resource "google_managed_kafka_acl" "example" {
  acl_id = "allTopics"
  cluster = google_managed_kafka_cluster.cluster.cluster_id
  location = "australia-southeast1"

  acl_entries {
    principal = "User:${google_service_account.service_account.email}"
    permission_type = "DENY"
    operation = "ALL"
    host = "*"
  }
}
```

After you’ve applied it, you’ll see an unauthorised error when trying to publish to a non-existent topic.

That’s all that's required. If you had another approach in mind, feel free to let me know in the comments below.
