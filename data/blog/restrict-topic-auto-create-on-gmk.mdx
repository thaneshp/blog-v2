summary: How to restrict topics from auto creating on Google Managed Kafka.
---

If you've used Google Managed Kafka (GMK), you might have notice there is no setting to disable auto creation of topics.

Disabling auto creation of topics is managed by the property `auto.create.topics.enable` server-side property that Google Managed Kafka doesn't expose to users.

Regardless, we can still restrict topics from auto creating by configuring ACL rules; which I explain below.

---

## Problem Statement

Topics are automatically created when a client producers (or consumes) to Google Managed Kafka.

This is actually a default feature of Apache Kafka but is often not preferred as it means topics aren't maintained in source control.

Essentially, there are resources which are created outside of Terraform, IaC or other form of configuration.

## Solution

You can restrict auto creation of topics on Google Managed Kafka by creating a service account and applying an ACL rule that denies `ALL` operations for `acl_id = "allTopics"`.


export const Callout = ({ type = "info", children }) => {
  const styles = {
    info: {
      border: "#3b82f6",
      background: "#eff6ff"
    },
    warning: {
      border: "#f59e0b",
      background: "#fffbeb"
    },
    danger: {
      border: "#ef4444",
      background: "#fef2f2"
    }
  };

  const style = styles[type];

  return (
    <div style={{
      padding: "1rem",
      borderLeft: `4px solid ${style.border}`,
      backgroundColor: style.background,
      borderRadius: "8px",
      margin: "1.2rem 0"
    }}>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
};


<Callout type="info">
**Why does this work?**

Google Managed Kafka operates with `allow.everyone.if.no.acl.found` property set to `true`.

When no ACL is present for `acl_id = "allTopics"`, then access is enabled by default. As soon as you apply an ACL to this resource, then access becomes restricted.

You can read more about GMK's default access [here](https://docs.cloud.google.com/managed-service-for-apache-kafka/docs/access-control-kafka-acls#default-access).
</Callout>

## Implementation

The Terraform implementation looks something like below.

```HCL
# Dummy service account used solely for applying the ACL rule
resource "google_service_account" "service_account" {
  account_id   = "service-account-id"
  display_name = "Service Account"
}

# ACL rule to restrict auto creation of topics
resource "google_managed_kafka_acl" "example" {
  acl_id = "allTopics"
  cluster = google_managed_kafka_cluster.cluster.cluster_id
  location = "australia-southeast1"

  acl_entries {
    principal = "User:${google_service_account.service_account.email}"
    permission_type = "DENY"
    operation = "ALL"
    host = "*"
  }
}
```

Once you've applied it, you'll see an not authorised error when trying to publish to a non-existent topic.
