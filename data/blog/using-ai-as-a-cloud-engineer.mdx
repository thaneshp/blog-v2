summary: My approach to using AI as part of my daily work.

Almost daily, I’m asked about how I use AI in my daily life, from both technologists and non-technologists alike.

It has been over 3 years since the ChatGPT moment happened, and it feels as though we are all still trying to wrap our heads around how this AI puzzle fits into our work and daily lives.

From a Cloud Engineer PoV, the number one way I am using AI isn’t to write or generate code, but to learn and understand concepts.

In this blog, I lay out why this is my preferred way of using AI in the age of vibe coding and AI-enabled development.

I think that by now, most people have come across the term vibe coding.

If you haven’t, you must be living under a rock as this was one of the most popular buzzwords that frequented 2025.

Anyways, the premise of vibe coding is to have AI generate code whilst you as the engineer are behind the wheel coordinating the whole thing via natural language.

If you’ve written code prior to 2022, I don’t need to convince you of just how fascinating this advancement is.

The issue with vibe coding, however, is that it is only good for trivial use cases or low-stake environments, e.g. writing scripts or building a PoC/MVP.

Essentially, situations where failure is acceptable and can be easily managed.

As an engineer working in an enterprise environment, I believe there is a duty of care required when changing a system.

The systems that we work on affect the lives of individual people and the customers who have placed that trust in the organisation to serve them.

As a cloud engineer, SRE or any engineer for that matter, our job isn’t simply to accept whether something works but to account for the worst-case scenario, and the impact of a system failure.

Keeping this in mind, vibe coding or AI-enabled coding doesn’t quite fit the bill in my opinion.

But…. hear me out.

Alright, so here is how I use AI in my daily job and what I think is the most approriate way to leverage AI in its current form.

First and foremost, I always turn off Agent mode when using co-pilot. Rightly or wrongly, I don’t want AI to make any changes to the codebase that I haven’t thoroughly understood.

I use only Ask mode, and only ask queries:a. to help me understand a particular concept OR

b. to generate code that I review and manually add into the codebase

For me personally, this gives me confidence as an engineer that I know what changes I am making before they have the potential to affect anyone else.

However, there is a caveat to this.

If I know the change I am making has relatively low/minor impact, then I might lean on AI more heavily, e.g. a bash script to automate a repetitive task to make my life more convenient.

There is no hard and fast rule for this; and a big part of what we do daily is deciding what tool to use when. 

And, the same goes for AI…
