I've been thinking a lot about distributed systems lately, and how they relate to modern application architectures and cloud-native technologies.

In this post, I'll share some of my thoughts on the subject.

## What makes a system distributed?

Distributed systems are a type of system where the components are distributed across multiple machines.

The core premise of a distributed system is to enable scalability, fault-tolerance, resource utilization.

A system is considered distributed if it meets the following criteria:

- The system is compbosed of multiple independent components.
- The components are distributed across multiple machines.
- The components are loosely coupled and can operate independently. 

An example of a distributed system is Kubernetes or Apache Kafka. I.e. where there are multiple nodes (machines) that are working together to achieve a common goal, managed by a central authority.

## Goals of Distributed Systems

The core goals of a distributed system are:

1. Fault-tolerance
2. Scalability
3. Resource utilization

### Fault-tolerance

Fault-tolerance is the ability of a system to continue operating even in the presence of faults, i.e. where some components are not working as expected.

Fault-tolerance is generally measure in terms of availability, i.e. fraction of the time that the system is operational.

- 99.9% availability -> 1 minute of downtime per week
- 99.99% availability -> 5 minutes of downtime per month
- 99.999% availability -> 31 seconds of downtime per month  

When designing a distributed system, we need to consider the following:

- Service Level Objectives (SLOs) - What is the acceptable level of availability for the system?
- Service Level Agreements (SLAs) - What is the agreement between the system and the users?

> We can think of availabily zones in a cloud environment as a way to achieve fault-tolerance; whereby if one zone goes down, the system can continue to operate in another zone.

## Scalability

Scalability is the ability of a system to handle an increasing amount of work, or load, by adding more resources based on the demand.

In a distributed system, there are two types of scalability:

- Horizontal scalability (scaling out)
- Vertical scalability (scaling up)

Horizontal scalability is achieved by adding more machines to the system, while vertical scalability is achieved by adding more resources to the existing machines.

> In a cloud environment, scalability should be an automatic process, whereby the system can automatically scale out or scale up based on the demand.

## Resource utilization

Resource utilization is the ability of a system to use resources efficiently.

In a distributed system, we can use resources efficiently by distributing the work across multiple machines and dividing the workload based on the functional boundaries of the system.

This approach allows for more efficient use of resources, as we can allocate resources based on the demand for each specific part of system.

As an added benefit, this approach may also reduce SPOF (Single Point of Failure) and increase the overall availability of the system.

> We can think of a microservice architecture as a way to achieve resource utilization, whereby we can allocate resources for each specific part of the system.

## Challenges of Distributed Systems





Distributed systems are complex, and there are many challenges to consider when designing and building them.

One of the main challenges is maintaining consistency, i.e. how to ensure that all the components of the system are working together in a consistent way.
