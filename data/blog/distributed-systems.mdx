summary: The idea and core concepts behind distributed systems.
---

Distributed systems are a type of system where the components are distributed across multiple machines.

The core premise of a distributed system is to enable scalability, fault-tolerance, resource utilization.

## What makes a system distributed?

A system is considered distributed if it meets the following criteria:

- The system is composed of multiple independent components.
- The components are distributed across multiple machines.
- The components are loosely coupled and can operate independently. 

An example of a distributed system is Kubernetes or Apache Kafka. I.e. where there are multiple nodes (machines) that are working together to achieve a common goal, managed by a central authority.

## Goals of Distributed Systems

The core goals of a distributed system are:

- Fault-tolerance
- Scalability
- Resource utilization

### Fault-tolerance

Fault-tolerance is the ability of a system to continue operating even in the presence of faults, i.e. where some components are not working as expected.

In Kubernetes, this may be a node that is not responding, or a pod that is not working as expected.

Fault-tolerance is generally measure in terms of availability, i.e. fraction of the time that the system is operational.

- 99.9% availability -> 1 minute of downtime per week
- 99.99% availability -> 5 minutes of downtime per month
- 99.999% availability -> 31 seconds of downtime per month  

When designing a distributed system, we need to consider the following:

- Service Level Objectives (SLOs)
- Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

## Scalability

Scalability is the ability of a system to handle an increasing amount of work, or load, by adding more resources based on the demand.

In a distributed system, we can scale horizontally by adding more machines, or vertically by adding more resources to the existing machines.

We may scale horizontally when we have a large number of users, or when we have a large amount of data to process.

We may scale vertically when we have a large amount of data to process, or when an application is CPU or memory bound.

## Resource utilization

Resource utilization is the ability of a system to use resources efficiently.

In a distributed system, we can use resources efficiently by distributing the work across multiple machines.

Instead of having a single monolithic application, we can have multiple smaller applications that each handle a specific part of the workload.

This way we can have a more efficient use of resources, by spreading the load across multiple machines.

This may also reduce SPOF (Single Point of Failure) and increase the overall availability of the system.

## Challenges of Distributed Systems

Distributed systems are complex, and there are many challenges to consider when designing and building them.

One of the main challenges is maintaining consistency, i.e. how to ensure that all the components of the system are working together in a consistent way.
