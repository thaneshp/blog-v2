summary: 4 lessons I learnt using AI tools to build software.
---

I’ve been coding since high school (~ a decade ago now).

I remember back in the day, writing code in Visual Basic to build a school portal app for my final year high-school project; designing the app on a whiteboard, stringing together bits of code cobbled from the internet and putting together an application over many months.

How things have changed…

In today’s AI-era, everyone can build apps in a matter of days (as opposed to months or years).

I've been building [co-asset-hub](https://co-asset-hub.lovable.app/), a personal finance asset tracking tool for my household; and have learnt some things along the way.

This post is to share some of those lessons to give you some ideas as you build.

## Lesson 1: Have a clear vision before crafting your first prompt

The first prompt is the most important prompt of your project as it sets up the foundation of your app.

Have a clear vision of what you are trying to achieve, and workshop the idea with ChatGPT (or another LLM of your choice).

Then once you are ready, ask the same LLM to craft you a first prompt that you will use to kick off your project.

## Lesson 2: Develop/utilise a Knowledge Base

Maintain a knowledge base/context of your application so that you can easily feed it into any AI tool of choice as you progress.

You want your knowledge base to comprise PRDs, themes, user flows, and in-scope vs. out-of-scope features.

Again, you can use your choice of LLM to workshop and refine this as much as your heart desires.

Keep in mind: your knowledge base does not have to be static. As your app changes, your requirements may also change, and so you can update this at any time.

Tip: You can also ask your AI tool of choice to generate pieces of context regarding your app anytime you desire.

## Lesson 3: Make small iterations

AI works best when you are explicit about what you want and ask for small changes as opposed to big changes (or many things).

Make sure each prompt is concentrated and ask for small pieces of functionality; iterating bit by bit.

Use a structured approach where appropriate, i.e. user stories, json, etc.

Personally, I like to write prompts as user stories as it's quicker to write.

As a user, I want to …., so that ….

Acceptance Criteria:

## Lesson 4: Debugging and Fixing Issues

You will inevitably run into issues, i.e. either some piece of functionality doesn’t work as expected or a feature doesn’t align with your vision.

What worked for me:

1. Use chat mode where possible and ask the AI to investigate the issue. Validate the output makes sense, and then ask it to apply.
2. Combine use of AI tools, i.e. switch between Cursor, Codex, Copilot, etc.
3. Reframe your prompt a different way or get ChatGPT (or similar) to reframe it for you.

Most importantly: Get some fresh air, go for a walk, come back with a clear mind. You’d be suprise how effective this strategy is.

## Final Thoughts

This guide isn’t perfect, but I hope it gives you a place to get started. 

The more you do, the more you'll learn along the way.

Gone are the days that you need X amount of technical experitise or experience to build.

Today, all you need is a vision.

What will you build?
