Hi, my name is Thanesh.

My career in technology began as an Infrastructure Engineer, applying patches and resolving incidents on on-premise VMware and Linux systems. 

Throughout this time, I always embraced an *automate everything* mindset to everything I did; which by chance led me to my current role as a Site Reliability Engineer. Since then, I’ve been involved in building Google Cloud environments and developing tools/frameworks for automating deployments.

Outside of engineering, I’ve always been curious by nature. I love learning new technologies, building side projects, reading, traveling, and engaging with others. I believe that constantly re-educating myself is a lifelong pursuit.
