Welcome! I’m Thanesh — an engineer, lifelong learner, and problem-solver. I’m passionate about using technology to build solutions that matter, especially when they drive impact, reduce friction, or unlock potential at scale.

My career so far has revolved around building reliable, scalable infrastructure to support cloud migrations and drive cloud adoption — applying SRE principles like automation, observability, and resilience. I’ve worked across teams to shift traditional operations into cloud-native, GitOps-driven environments, where deployment is fast, systems are transparent, and reliability is built-in.

Lately, I’ve been exploring how AI and foundational models fit into modern engineering — not just from a technical standpoint, but how they reshape organizations, workflows, and decision-making.

Outside of engineering, I’m curious by nature. I have a strong interest in psychology - especially how people think, make decisions, and interact in complex systems. I believe great engineering is as much about empathy and clarity as it is about code.
