Welcome! I’m Thanesh — an engineer, lifelong learner, and problem-solver. I’m passionate about using technology to build solutions that matter, especially when they drive impact, reduce friction, or unlock potential at scale.

My career so far has revolved around building reliable, scalable infrastructure to support cloud migrations and drive cloud adoption; applying SRE principles like automation, observability, and resilience.

Outside of engineering, I’m curious by nature. I love learning new technologies, building side projects, reading, traveling, and engaging with others. I believe that constantly re-educating myself is a lifelong pursuit.
