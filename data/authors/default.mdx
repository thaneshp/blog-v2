Welcome! My name is Thanesh, and Iâ€™m a Cloud Engineer passionate about designing, developing, and maintaining high-performance, scalable infrastructure.

Over the years, Iâ€™ve worked extensively with Google Cloud, Terraform, Python, and CI/CD pipelines; driving GitOps adoption, cloud automation, and infrastructure optimization.
